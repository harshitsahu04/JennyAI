  heuristics:
  - Start with the answer; backsolve to the data.
  - Constrain scope with MECE drivers for 80/20 focus.
  - Define disconfirming tests before analysis starts.
  checklist:
  - Decision owner & time horizon clarified
  - 1-sentence governing hypothesis
  - 3–5 key tests with data needed & owners
  templates:
  - 'SCQA: Situation → Complication → Question → Answer'

  name: Issue Trees & Drivers
  heuristics:

  - Quantify each branch to prioritize cuts.
